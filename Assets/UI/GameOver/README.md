# Game Over Screen Design Variants

This document describes the three game over screen design variants created for team evaluation and selection.

## Overview

Three distinct game over screen prototypes have been created, each with a unique design philosophy and user experience approach. The team should evaluate these variants based on readability, user feedback clarity, and overall aesthetic fit with the game.

## Variant 1: Clean Centered Layout

**File Location:** `Assets/UI/GameOver/game_over_variant1.tscn`  
**Script:** `Scripts/GameOver/game_over_variant1.gd`

## Variant 2: Detailed Stats-Based Layout

**File Location:** `Assets/UI/GameOver/game_over_variant2.tscn`  
**Script:** `Scripts/GameOver/game_over_variant2.gd`

### Design Philosophy

## Variant 3: Minimal Compact Layout

**File Location:** `Assets/UI/GameOver/game_over_variant3.tscn`  
**Script:** `Scripts/GameOver/game_over_variant3.gd`

### Design Philosophy

### User Flow
1. Screen fades in gradually (less jarring)
2. Player sees encouraging message

## Testing Instructions

To test each variant:

1. **Using Godot Editor:**
   - Open each `.tscn` file directly
   - Click "Play Scene" (F6) to preview
   - Test button interactions

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Add variant to a test scene
   - Trigger display when player dies/fails
   - Verify button functionality

3. **Visual Testing:**
   - Check at different resolutions
   - Verify text readability
   - Test button hover states
   - Ensure proper layering over game content

## Team Poll Recommendations

When conducting the team poll, consider asking:

1. **Aesthetic Preference**: Which design best matches our game's style?
2. **Readability**: Which text and layout is easiest to read?
3. **User Flow**: Which option flow feels most natural?
4. **Information Needs**: Do we need stats display (Variant 2)?
5. **Tone**: Which variant best conveys the right emotional tone?
6. **Extensibility**: Do we anticipate adding more features later?

### Suggested Voting Method
- Team members play the game and trigger each variant
- Rate each on a scale of 1-5 for:
  - Visual Appeal
  - Readability
  - User Experience
  - Fit with Game Theme
- Collect feedback on potential improvements
- Make final decision based on scores and discussion

## Next Steps After Selection

Once a variant is chosen:
1. Integrate into actual game flow
2. Connect to death/fail conditions
3. Implement proper scene transitions
4. Add sound effects for appearance/button clicks
5. Fine-tune based on playtesting feedback
6. Consider A/B testing with actual players if possible
